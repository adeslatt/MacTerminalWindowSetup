# First steps

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

Recently I just got a new logic board that required that I set up everything anew -- doing this meant that I had the opportunity to set everything up and document the steps I did.

**Time/Date:** 
January 28, 2022

Machine type:

1. Install homebrew. 
2. Get wget
3. Install Miniconda

## Install Home Brew

Now this has happened a number of times, I hope to have learned my lesson.  I use Dropbox to keep all my files in a cloud accessible and hence- platform ignorant manner.   I don't have to remember what I did.

This time, therefore, I navigated to my *teams* space.  

**`Scitechcon`** is my company name - short for **`Science and Technology Consulting, Inc.`**

annedeslattesmays@Annes-MacBook-Pro Anne DeslattesMays % ls -l
```

Google it "get homebrew mac" 

You will end up here **`brew.sh`**

Copy the line at the middle of the page.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Now get to work
